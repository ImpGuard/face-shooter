DSAPI release notes
-------------------

Version 1.6 (9/12/2014)
- Includes FW 60: See included Release notes in DSROOT/Data/DSFirmare/FirmwareReleaseNotes.txt
- Includes Visual Studio 2013 projects for Samples
- Split the installer to separate 32-bit and 64-bit targets.
- FW 60 fixes the YUY2 byte ordering issue, so 1.6 removes the compensation for the incorrect byte ordering in any section that 
  deals with YUY2 data.  This includes conversion to RGB formats and display code in our sample programs.
- Added support for 320x240 resolution modes for z/l/r streams
- Added support 100fps in all z/l/r resolutions
- Sync after grab is now exact.  Expect framecount to match in all active streams running at the same frame rate.
- Added check for minimum FW version in ProbeConfiguration. In case of misformated FW version, error is logged and check is disabled.
- Moved read/writeRegister to private interface
- Renamed read/writeRegister to set/getRegister, and read/writeImagerReg to set/getImagerRegister for consistent naming
- Renamed readTemperature to getTemperature for consistent naming
- Renamed DS_PXM to DS_PNM since PNM is the correct collection name for the formats (and on the other hand PXM is another valid image format)
- ZToDisparityConstant is now > 0 (it was previously incorrectly negative)
- DSFirmwareUpdate 
     - Added creation of recovery partition during update if it is not present
     - Updated mechanism for FW update to swap valid partition to recovery during update.
     - Added new required FW file to contain recovery FW data
     - CHANGED FILE NAMES OF FW FILES.  Now have 5 generic filenames in our release to make it easier to 
       to update on linux systems, specific version is embedded in all files.  
         DS4_Firmware.ibin: compatible with all OS
         DS4_Firmware.ihex, DS4_Firmware_Recovery.ihex: Compatible with Linux and Win8
       	 DS4_Firmware_Win7.ihex, DS4_Firmware_Recovery_Win7.ihex: compatible with Win7 and Win8
     - Default behavior (no command line args) on Windows systems is still load use Win7 files
     - New command line argument (-8) to force use of Linux/Win8 files.
     - Removed "LinuxFW" directory in release directory structure
Known Issues:
- 100fps 320x240 resolution fails to stream
- L/R Auto exposure mode can be set only before streaming


Version 1.5 (7/31/14) Internal release
- Includes FW 57 - please update your module. See included Release notes in DSROOT/Data/DSFirmare/FirmwareReleaseNotes.txt
- File Mode: added capture mode from live camera to files, and constructor (factory) object for DSFile - which processes 
  from files with common API to live camera.  Currently saves to png or ppm file formats. 1080p image are not saved at full frame rate. 
  Will be improving capture rate for next release.
- Introduced logging interface (based on log4cxx).  Controlled with setLoggingLevelAndFile function call to set log level 
  and file path.  Currently logs detected errors and some trace/debug data.  Addtional performance and status data 
  will be added over time.
- Support for new XU reset command. Including use of reset after DSFirmwareUpdate so replug will not be necessary to boot 
  to new FW (will see when update from FW 57 to FW 58).
- Support for new XU auto exposure (L/R) parameters command. (Auto exposure not fully supported yet).
- Moved to FreeGlut for all GL display 
- StopCapture method added.  Streaming is stopped and all configuration data reset to default.
- Known Issues:
Known Issues:
- Win8 provides full enumeration, Win7 sees only default frame rates (60 in LRZ and 30 for Third imager).
- Third to LRZ sync off by 0-3 frames.  WIP to better handle this in grab.
- Exposure and Gain settings currently persist after device stop and restart.  Should return to default state.
- Calling startCapture, stopCapture, then reconfiguring and calling startCapture again is possible, but
  currently not validated for all configuration.  Consider this feature not yet fully implemented.
- Starting and stopping the camera without unplug/replug of DS4 USB cable is working with the exception of after error state.
  If an error state (USB timeout or other fatal error) is signaled, unplug and replug to return to a healthy state.
- YUY2 byte ordering in the native image is incorrect.  This has been compensated for in our software API during conversion of YUY2 to other formats.
- Several configurations fail to stream, and do not return the system to a reliable state after failure without replug of USB cable:
   - 1920x1080  YUY2 format web at 30fps with any resolution z, left, right at 60fps.  
   - 640x480 YUY2 format web at 60fps with any resolution z at 60fps.
   - 1920x1080 RAW10 format web at 30fps with any resolution z at 30fps.  Fails also with addition of Left and right images.
   - 1920x1080 YUY2 format web at 30fps with any resolution z, left, and right at 30fps

Version 1.1 (7/18/14)
- Includes FW 56.  See included Release notes in DSROOT/Data/DSFirmare/FirmwareReleaseNotes.txt
- Changed install dir and key environment variable from c:\DS4Install\STROOT to c:\DS4Install\DSROOT
- Changed location of third party Bin files from %STROOT%\Install\Bin to %DSROOT%\ThirdParty\Bin
- Changed location of third party include and lib files to %DSROOT%\ThirdParty\<package>\Include and <package>\Lib
- Added implementation for getCameraSerialNumber
- Support all enumerated frame rates
- Support all enumberated pixel format types (new L/R formats for Left only)
- getFrameCountThird for YUY2 format images is now reporting correct value
- Initial exposure bug has been fixed.
- Added stopCapture method to DSAPI
- In most cases, no longer crashes when DSDestroy is called 
- Cold boot enumeration bug is fixed in FW
- YUY2 VGA ISP settings added. Should be similar color quality to 1080p.
Known Issues:
- Win8 provides full enumeration, Win7 sees on default frame rates (60 in LRZ and 30 for Third imager).
- FrameTime not implemented
- Third to LRZ sync off by 0-3 frames.  WIP to better handle this in grab.
- FW PU and XU controls have some inconsistancies in this version in initialization state and behavior during streaming. 
  These have been discussed and are being fixed by FW team.  PU Controls still not validated for Web camera (considered unimplemented).
- Calling startCapture, stopCapture, then reconfiguring and calling startCapture again is possible, but
  currently does not handle all reconfiguration correctly in FW.  Consider this feature not yet fully 
  implemented, but moving toward this goal.
- Starting and stopping the camera without unplug/replug of DS4 USB cable is working with the exception of after error state.
  If an error state (USB timeout or other fatal error) is signaled, unplug and replug to return to a healthy state.
- YUY2 byte ordering in the native image is incorrect.  This has been compensated for in our software API during conversion of YUY2 to other formats.
- Occasional white horizontal lines seen in Left/Right images in 480x360 resolution mode. (fixed for upcoming FW 57)
- Asking for too much data (e.g. largest resolutions for all 3 streams) compared to bandwidth your system can handle results in stream timeouts.  
  This is signaled as an error rather than graceful degradation.

Version 1.0 (6/23/14)
- Change in API enum names, removed _PF_ from DSPixelFormat.
- Both 32-bit and 64-bit builds for DLL and samples included. The 32-bit binaries have the suffix "32".
- Added isCalibrationValid() method
Known Issues:
- Sending rapid controls to DS4 modules during streaming (e.g. exposure) can still cause the streaming to hang
- FW XU Exposure Gain method has a bug with the initial setting.  This has been compensated for by setting an initial exposure & gain in API layer.  
  Exposure and gain settings made after StartCapture are otherwise fully functional.
- Starting and stopping the camera without unplug/replug of DS4 USB cable is working with the exception of after error state.
  If an error state (USB timeout or other fatal error) is signaled, unplug and replug to return to a healthy state.
- YUY2 byte ordering in the native image is incorrect.  This has been compensated for in our software API during conversion of YUY2 to other formats.
- YUY2 settings for color imager in VGA mode are yet not complete/tuned.  Image quality is not as good as 1920x1080 size.  
- RAW10 format third images are available only in native unrectified mode.  Utilities available for user conversion to RGB and for rectification for 1920x1080 resolution.
- Frame count is not currently embedded in YUY2 data, so frame count is not available for sync evaluation.
- Device is not recognized after boot (unplug/replug required).
- Occasional white horizontal lines seen in Left/Right images in 480x360 resolution mode.
- Asking for too much data (e.g. largest resolutions for all 3 streams) compared to bandwidth your system can handle results in stream timeouts.  
  This is signaled as an error rather than graceful degradation.

Version 0.6 (6/12/14)
- Distributed with FW 54
- The DSAPI, DSThird and DSEmitter interfaces are fully functional for the DS_DS4_PLATFORM platform.
- The DSHardware interface is not fully functional and hasn't been tested.
- Interface and type name changes, so will break existing software that are built against the 0.5 version.
- Added DSGpuRectificationGL sample program to demonstrate display of rectified third images using GPU and CPU.
- Added DSPointCloudGL sample program to demonstrate usage of calibration related interface and utility functions.

Version 0.5 (6/4/14)
- The very first released version.
