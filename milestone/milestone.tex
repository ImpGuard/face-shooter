% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:

% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
% declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
% \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
% and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
% every instance of \includegraphics
% \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}

% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/


% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.

\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} project will create an automated NERF turret that can detect a target \hl{(a human face)}, aim, and fire at the target. The project will model the detection and aiming of a target as a state machine governed by the combination of RGBD camera data and other sensor inputs to \hl{correctly rotate the turret and incline the NERF gun to aim at the target.} The goal will be to accurately detect a target and fire accurately for maximum effect.

\section{Project Requirements}

The general requirements that can be measured to determine the success of our turret are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item
The turret platform supports full \SI{360}{\degree} rotation.
\item
The turret platform supports an incline angle between \SI{0}{\degree} and \SI{30}{\degree}.
\item
The turret is able to perform facial recognition.
\item
The turret can accurately hit a stationary target (human face) within the range of 5 meters.
\item
In the case of communication error, turret support successful tracking target to the last known location. 
\end{itemize}

\section{System Components}

A diagram illustrating the system components for this project is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:components}. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.80\linewidth]{components.png}
    \caption{System components hierarchy}
    \label{fig:components}
\end{figure}

In general, the system is divided into two overarching components: (1) the NERF Turret and (2) the Microcontroller. Each component can be subdivided further as shown in the diagram. In general, the NERF Turret component is responsible for providing the actuators that control the rotating platform - a turntable made of bearings, motors, and a winch -, an electronically triggered NERF gun mounted on the platform, and the RGBD camera sensor that performs the face recognition. On the other hand, the microcontroller component is responsible for providing the controller api calls that appropriately handle the high and low level control of the system. The microcontroller is connected to the actuators via wired connections, and to the sensors using a WiFi connection via the Adafruit CC3000 chip.

The four person group is divided into two subgroups that each handle one of the two overarching components. That is, one group handled the difficulties of acquiring a NERF gun, constructing a turret, and setting up sensors, while another handled the control system and the communication.

\section{Updates}

The updates that we have for the various system components are described below.

\subsection{NERF Turret Actuators}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.80\linewidth]{gun.jpg}
    \caption{The CS-18 that has been cut open to allow electrical input.}
    \label{fig:gun}
\end{figure}

The NERF gun and the motors on the turret are the actuators in our system. We selected the CS-18, which was chosen since it was not only relatively lightweight, but also entirely electronically controlled which allowed us to swap out the switches of the firing mechanism. Figure~\ref{fig:gun} below shows the result of disassembling the gun to allow electronic firing.

Currently, we have disassembled the NERF gun and reverse-engineered it to the point where we can electronically trigger it to fire a NERF dart. In addition, we have obtained two relays to replace the trigger switches in the gun in order to connect it to the microcontroller. Relays are used since they are more easily controlled via a GPIO pin on the microcontroller.

For the turret we have begun drafting what we will be using to rotate the turret and how we will mount the gun on it.

\subsection{RGBD Camera and Face Recognition}

We have decided to use an Intel RealSense 3D Camera to handle face recognition. This camera was chosen since it has a small form factor and provides RGBD information at 30 frames per second. The RGB information is important in order to perform face recognition, and the depth information will be useful to allow the NERF gun to properly target the face once it is detected.

A limitation of this camera is that it must be connected to a Windows 8 computer via USB3, but it only came with a short cable. To get around this limitation, we ordered a 2 meter USB3 extension cable.

On the software side, we have C++ code that reads from the camera and uses OpenCV to detect faces. Figure~\ref{fig:face} shows a demo of this behavior.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{face_detection.png}
    \caption{Going counter-clockwise  from the top right - Depth Map, RGB Image, and Face Detection}
    \label{fig:face}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Controller}

\vspace{3mm}
\begin{lstlisting}[
    caption={Basic demo code controlling the NERF gun.},
    label={lst:controller}
    ]
#include "mbed.h"
#include "TSISensor.h"

DigitalOut flywheel(PTB8);
DigitalOut trigger (PTE20);

TSISensor tsi;

float eps = 0.001;

int main() {
  flywheel = 1;
  while(1) {
    if (tsi.readPercentage() < eps)
      continue;
    trigger = 1;
    wait(0.4);
    trigger = 0;
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

We have decided to use the MBED microcontroller to handle the control algorithm. Currently, we are able to control firing of the NERF gun with the MBED, via wired connection between the microcontroller and the relays. In the code shown in Listing~\ref{lst:controller}, we have set the microcontroller to trigger the NERF gun when the capacitive touch sensor is touched. Figure~\ref{fig:chip} shows the chip connected to the relays via the proper GPIO pins.


\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.78\linewidth]{chip.jpg}
    \caption{An image of the MBED chip connected to the two relays. These would be connected to the NERF gun to electronically fire the gun.}
    \label{fig:chip}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Communication}

We have selected WiFi for our connection scheme mainly since it is easy and serves its purpose well for our requirements. We are tracking a static target, and, therefore, are perfectly fine with some latency with our communication protocol. However, we have had several problems using the Adafruit CC3000 chip with the MBED processor to connect to a network, and have yet been able to maintain a consistent connection.

\section{Future Plans}

This is what we expect to accomplish moving forwards:

\begin{itemize}
\item[1)]
Build the turret platform.
\item[2)]
Implement the targeting algorithm.
\item[3)]
Set up server for communication between sensor and controller, via WiFi connection.
\item[4)]
Integrate all the components.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Turret}

The plan for the turret has changed, and we are currently planning on making a turntable out of some bearings (ordered), a motor, and a winch. The motor will turn the table and be controlled by the microcontroller, which will be used to rotate the gun to line up in one direction. The winch will be mounted on the turntable and connected to the NERF gun, which can be be turned by a motor until the target is in position.

\subsection{Communication}

We are still working on creating a simple server connection so that the microcontroller can recieve data from the face recognition software and, therefore, move the turret based off of a face's position in space.
